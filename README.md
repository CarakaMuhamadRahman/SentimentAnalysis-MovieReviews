Sentiment Analysis Using Naive Bayes Algorithm

This project used the Naive Bayes Algorithm to performed Classification. And also because the number of data sample from each classes was not balance, I used SMOTE to performed the Oversampling Technique. The purpose of SMOTE Algorithm was to sample the data in each class equally. The think that made this project looked special was because i code this Algorithm from scratch, without any library. The final accuracy score for this Sentiment Analysis model was 84%.
